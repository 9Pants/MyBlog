        <p>Iâ€™m David Mitchell, and I have been a Systems Engineer for 20 years. I have
        started developing with MATLAB, Python and Django and this is my personal site 
        to document experiences and anything I found useful. It is also a test platform for
        features and deployment.</p>

        <p>This site contains my personal opinionated views and hopefully they will help with issues you may be having.
        Please take all advice with a pinch of salt and
