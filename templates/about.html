        <p>Iâ€™m David Mitchell, I have been a Systems Engineer for 20 years, and I have recently
        started developing with MATLAB, Python and Django. 
        This is my personal site to record experiences and anything I found useful. It is also a test platform for
        features and deployment.</p>
