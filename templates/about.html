        <p>Iâ€™m David Mitchell (no not that one!), and I use MATLAB, Python and Django for web design and data analysis.
        This is my personal site to document experiences and anything I find useful. It is also a test platform for
        features and deployment.</p>

        <p>I have been a Systems Engineer for 20 years mostly in Aeropsace.
        Starting at Marshall of Cambridge Aerospace, I moved to building airships at
        Hybrid Air Vehicles, with the documentary worth a watch on 
        <a href="https://sparksflymedia.co.uk/story-of-airlander-shop/">DVD</a> or

        <p>This site contains my personal opinionated views and hopefully they will help with issues you may be having.
